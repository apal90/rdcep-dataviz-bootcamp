  `numpy` and `matplotlib`

  `matplotlib` is the 'standard' graphic interface for python. It purports
  to provide an environment familiar to MATLAB users.

  Other libraries for data viz exists, and will be explored during the
  course of this workshop. But `matplotlib` is perhaps the most
  powerful that is available in the python ecosystem.

  It's a real pain to use.
